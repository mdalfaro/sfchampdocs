Highway Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Highway assignment is the process of loading vehicle trips onto the roadway network. In assignment, each vehicle trip searches for a route with the lowest generalized cost (considering travel time and toll costs). The assignment model iteratively reassigns trips until the model converges towards a user-equilibrium condition. Skimming is the process of evaluating the components of generalized cost for all origin and destination pairs. Assignment and skimming is conducted separately for the five SF-CHAMP time of day periods: AM Peak, midday, PM Peak, evening, and late night/early morning.
