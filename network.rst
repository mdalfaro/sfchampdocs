Network Supply Models
---------------------
The supply models consist of assigning travel demand onto transportation networks, and then evaluating how those transportation networks perform. There are separate models for roadway and transit supply. Both models use the Citilabs Cube software package for assignment (assigning trips to networks) and skimming (evaluating travel times and costs for travel between origins and destinations after trips have been assigned to the networks).
