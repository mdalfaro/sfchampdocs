Transit Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transit assignment and skimming is similar to highway assignment and skimming, except that transit trips are assigned to the transit network. Transit assignment is inherently more complicated because transit trips can include walk or drive access segments, one or more transit services, and transit trips face a variety of fare policies. SF-CHAMP uses Citilabs Cube software for transit assignment and skimming.
